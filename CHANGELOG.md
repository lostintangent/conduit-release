## 📆 11/17/25

- <ins>Syntax highlighting:</ins> Editor panes now display proper syntax highlighting for most common languages (e.g. CSS, HTML, JSON, TypeScript)

- <ins>Pane synchronization</ins> You can now mark a tab as being synchronized, which allows you to type in one terminal and have those same keypresses synchronized to every other terminal.

- <ins>Splitting browsers/editors:</ins> The command palette now includes commands for splitting a new browser or editor pane, in all four directions (e.g. `Split Browser Pane Left`). Additionally, the `conduit` CLI's `split-pane` command now includes a new `-t|--type` option, which can be `terminal`, `editor`, or `browser`, in order to create a split of all three pane types.

- <ins>File tree filter:</ins> The editor pane's tree mode filter is now persisted in workspaces, which allows you to configure the tree and how that behavior remain across sessions.
