# 🤔 What is Conduit?

Conduit is a "workspace manager" for parallelizing coding tasks with agents, across both local and cloud compute. It allows you to design fully-bespoke development workflows, which are organized as arbitrarily-flexible tabs of terminals, editors, and browsers. Because of its focus on customization, built around a core set of primitives, we jokingly refer to it as a "DIY-DE".

To give a better sense of what this means, let's take a look at what Conduit can do...
   
### Bespoke dev environments

Create information-dense tabs, each with a flexible grid of terminal, editor, and browser panes (that can be resized, organized, collapsed, and cloned)

And once your tabs feel exactly like you want, you can then lock them, to prevent accidentally changes.

### Agent sessions

Create isolated agent sandboxes, by simply spliting new terminals, or duplicating tabs, with automatic worktree management.

### Cloud terminals

Spin up cloud terminals and intermingle them with local terminals, so you can parallelize your tasks even further.

### Agent customizations

Define and configure all of the coding agents you use, so you can quickly recall them via a slash command from any terminal.

### Design mode

Organize your tabs by creating or removing panes, drag & dropping panes, splitting panes into new tabs, moving panes between tabs, etc. All with a fun and visual editing surface.

You can also configure the radial "quick actions", so its simple to create the exact panes and layouts you want.

### Focus mode

Zoom in and out of panes in a tab (w/`cmd+option+f`), so you can seamlessly transition between focusing and observing (with a really fun minimap!)

### Tab preview / overview

Hover over any tab and see a **live preview** of its status. This is kind of like "peek definition" for tabs, and makes it easy to parallelize work, while keeping an eye on background tasks.

When you have multiple tabs, you can open a live "birds-eye view" of them all, which makes it easy to observe multiple tasks at once.

### Editor panes

Add editor panes to any tab, which provide a file explorer + text editor, complete with real-time git status, diffs, and the ability to stage, commit, push and pull changes.

### Quick actions

Perform one-off actions without needing to disrupt your tab layouts, or switching to another tool.

### Conduit CLI

Using the `conduit` CLI, you (and your coding agents!) can design, interact, and automate every part of your dev environment (including terminals and browsers!).

### Synchronized panes

Create multiple terminal panes, that can be synchronized, so that as you type, you can orchestrate/steer them all at once.

### Workspaces

Save and restore sets of tabs, so you can jump in and out of projects with ease.

### Customizable keybindings

Configure the keybindings that are used for common actions, so you can maximize your flow state exactly as you want it.

### Command palette

Run global commands at any time (`cmd+shift+p`), including spinning up quick terminal instances (w/an MRU list).
