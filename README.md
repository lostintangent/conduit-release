# 🤔 What is Conduit?

Conduit is a workspace manager for parallelizing tasks with coding agents. In practice, this means that Conduit is a terminal, a tiling window manager, an agentic task manager, and a lightweight editor + browser. Ultimately though, Conduit is a toolchain for AI-native, CLI-driven development, that's meant to make it easy (and fun!) to manage multiple tasks at a time. 

It takes massive inspiration from tools like Emacs, tmux, and VS Code, in order to provide a flexible workbench, that's built around composable tabs + panes of terminals (local/cloud), editors, and browsers. And it tries to layer on a ton of features that make it feel accessible enough to use everyday (hopefully!).

That said, since pictures are worth a whole bunch of words...check out the following parade of screenshots in oder to get a sense of what it can do...

# 🔌 Conduit

Create information-dense tabs, each with a flexible grid of terminal, editor, and browser panes (that can be arbitrarily resized, and organized)

**Tab previews**

Hover over any tab and see a **live preview** of its status. This is kind of like "peek definition" for tabs, and makes it easy to parallelize work, while keeping an eye on background tasks.

**Tabs overview**

When you have multiple tabs, you can open a live "birds-eye view" of them all, which makes it easy to observe multiple tasks at once.

**Design mode**

Organize your tabs by creating or removing panes, drag & dropping panes, splitting panes into new tabs, moving panes between tabs, etc.

You can also configure the radial "quick actions", so your design mode experience is exactly what you want it to be.

**Focus mode**

Zoom in and out of panes in a tab (w/`cmd+option+f`), so you can seamlessly transition between focusing and observing (with a really fun minimap!)

**Quick actions**

Perform one-off actions without needing to disrupt your tab layouts, or switching to another tool.

**Workspaces**

Save and restore sets of tabs, so you can jump in and out of projects with ease.

**Agent sessions**

Create isolated agent environments, by spinning up new terminals with automatic worktree management.

**Cloud terminals**

Spin up cloud terminals and intermingle them with local terminals, so you can parallelize your tasks even further.

**Customizable keybindings**

Configure the keybindings that are used for common actions, so you can maximize your flow state exactly as you want it.

**Command palette**

Run global commands at any time (`cmd+shift+p`), including spinning up quick terminal instances (w/an MRU list).
